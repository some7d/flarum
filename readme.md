## Goals

Flarum is the combined successor of [esoTalk](http://esotalk.org) and [FluxBB](http://fluxbb.org). It aims to be:

- **Fast and simple.** No clutter, no bloat, no complex dependencies. Flarum is built with PHP so it's quick and easy to deploy. The interface is powered by Mithril, a performant JavaScript framework with a tiny footprint.
- **Beautiful and responsive.** This is forum software for humans. Flarum is carefully designed to be consistent and intuitive across platforms, out-of-the-box.
- **Powerful and extensible.** Customize, extend, and integrate Flarum to suit your community. Flarum's architecture is amazingly flexible, prioritizing comprehensive APIs and great [documentation](http://flarum.org/docs).
- **Free and open.** Flarum is released under the [MIT license](https://github.com/flarum/flarum/blob/master/LICENSE).

## Installation

> **Flarum is currently in beta and should not be used in production.** It is being developed openly on GitHub. Check out the [Roadmap](http://flarum.org/roadmap) to follow along with our progress.

To give Flarum a spin, go to the [Download](http://flarum.org/download) page. You'll need a server with **PHP 5.5+** and **MySQL 5.5+**.

If you want to hack on Flarum, you'll need to set up a development environment. Read how in the [Contributing docs](http://flarum.org/docs/contributing)!
